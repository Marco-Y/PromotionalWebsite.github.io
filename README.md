<b>Self Introduction</b>

Hello, my name is Marco Yeung and I am currently 14. I was born in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg/1200px-Flag_of_Hong_Kong.svg.png">Hong Kong</a> and I live in Edmonton, my parents are Chinese so I could speak both <a href="https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/images/q_auto,f_auto/gigs/164382750/original/590864ae96f6bbbfd967dbb8c41d86bfb1cd8117/accurately-translate-english-cantonese-and-chinese-mandarin.jpg">Chinese and English</a>. I like playing badminton and football as well as listening to music. 

<b>Career Plans</b>

I have gained a huge interest in computing and technology since I was in elementary school and I hope to get a job related to coding and programming in the future because it seems to be the thing that I'm the most obsessed with.
